This project is to analyze four different versions of TCP(Reno, Cubic, Vegas, BBR) by measuring and comparing some metrics, such as throughput, delay and fairness, under the same network environment, so that we can have a better understanding of different congestion control algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages.

To measure throughput and delay, we have two end hosts connected by a router.

To measure fairness, we have four clients each using a unique version of TCP, and one server.
